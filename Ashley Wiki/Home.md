## What is Ashley?

A tiny entity framework written in Java. It is inspired by frameworks like
[Ash](http://www.ashframework.org/) (hence the name) and
[Artemis](http://gamadu.com/artemis/). Ashley tries to be a high-performance
entity framework  without the use of black-magic and thus making the API easy
and transparent to use.

You do not know what an Component Based Entity System (ECS) is? Check the [[About Entity Systems]] page first. 

Here is a list of [games made with Ashley](https://github.com/libgdx/ashley/wiki/Games-made-with-Ashley).

## About this wiki

Throughout this wiki, we will cover the entirety of Ashley, the fundamentals of Entity Systems and how to design games following this approach.

This is a manual, for a comprehensive API reference, check the [official javadocs](http://libgdx.badlogicgames.com/ashley/docs/).

## Technical considerations

Ashley is compatible with Java 6 and [GWT](http://www.gwtproject.org/), which means you can also target the browser.

Thanks to its [Apache 2.0](https://github.com/libgdx/ashley/blob/master/LICENSE) license, users have the freedom to use it, modify it and redistribute as they please. Commercial purposes are perfectly allowed.

Rest assured, we're continuously testing Ashley with Jenkins and JUnit.
