When you have content that can be of an unexpected size, it is a great idea to stick it into a ScrollPane. It automatically crops the content and adds scrollbars for panning. You can also use flick scrolling for a more mobile feel. 

# ScrollPaneStyle

# ScrollPane Layout

By default, scrollbar fading and flick scrolling are enabled. 

Disabling these options is a simple operation. If you have content that requires dragging, you need to disable flick dragging. 

If you don't have enough content to exceed the bounds of the scrollpane, the scrollbars are not displayed. This proves to be a problem when you have content that changes in size. The width of the content will vary widly as it tries to accommodate adding and removing the scrollbar.
