Defining colors allows you to easily configure the appearance of your fonts/drawables and manage those colors from one central location.

# Creating a New Color

* Go to *Project >> Colors*
* Click *New Color*

A color can be selected from the model or input via the number spinners. You can also paste in a hexadecimal value from your favorite image editor into the *#* field. Click *OK*, then enter a name. Names must begin with a letter and must only contain letters, numbers, underscores, and hyphens.

# Modifying an Existing Color

* Go to *Project >> Colors*
* Click the *gear button* next to the color you want to rename
* Click the *color button* next to the color you want to change

This technique will automatically recolor any styles, fonts, or drawables that use this color. This is a great technique to test different looks for your skin.

# Deleting a Color

* Go to *Project >> Colors*
* Click the *trash button* next to the color you want to delete

Note that this will remove the color from any style, drawable, or font that uses this color without prompt.
