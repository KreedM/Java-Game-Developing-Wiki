Skin Composer does not have direct support for VisUI. A VisUI template can be accessed from the welcome screen, however. This adds custom classes that include all of the VisUI widgets. See the documentation on [custom classes](https://github.com/raeleus/skin-composer/wiki/Custom-Classes). No standard preview will be visible.

# Create a VisUI Skin

* Go to *File >> Welcome Screen*
* Click on *VisUI Template*
* Fill the Vis widgets as you would with a normal skin
